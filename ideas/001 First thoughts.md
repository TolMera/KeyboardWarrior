So, I'm going to make a game where you have to type in what you hear, or maybe read from screen and type from screen.

What you're typing, and how well you type it will effect the hero that you summon to fight for your world.

If you are slow, you get a slower hero, if you are fast, you get a faster hero.  If you mis-spell words, you get a less agile hero, if you spell everything correctly you get a more agile hero.

Stuff like that

Stats will be STR, DEX, INT, ENDURANCE, LUCK

I think we will also make the chant something that indicates what equipment the person gets to start with?  So "A hero Armoured in Light, with a dark steel blade, eyes afire under the heml of brightest white" will get you those pieces of equipment....

Maybe I should have several overlapping chants, and you can type whichever one you can follow, and you could switch between the one you're listening to, so you can mix and match to get equipment etc.

I would like the game to have a backend as well, so we could do something like - have a group of people adventure together.  Or have your hero challenge another players hero.

One of the mechanics that I thought of, was if you make the person type action that you want them to do, and again speed and accuract counts.  So if you're facing off against a band of orc, you want to "run away" and if you type that quickly, then you succeed, if you're slow, then you get murdered by orcs.
